# Youtube_Comment_Spam_Id
This is an API for collecting youtube comments and using OpenAI GPT-Turbo to classify them into scam/spam comments or not.
There is also an HTML front end that will allow you to paste a youtube video link and get back a list of the users who are likely leaving spam/scam comments and the comments associated with each spam user.
